# IFT799-DataScience
A repistory for IFT799 Data Science (Science des donn√©es) course at the University of Sherbrooke.

## TODO
1. The display of the var stdRatings was fixed, so need to execute again the cell of the notebook to display the correct value of std (and the std was applied on all books, we need to apply this on each book for better analysis)

2. I think the max and min Rating display is wrong. We need to display the best rated book and the worst rated book.

3. Find the 25% of the best rated books (method)

4. median, Q1, Q3, std of rate of each book

5. Compare 2 asin (2 books) to know what is the better of them

6. Find a way to use another metric than mean to compare book's rate

7. Discuss box plot results ?
